# Roadmap for Cytoscape Fcose Layout Plugin

This document outlines the current status and future improvements planned for the fcose layout plugin.

## Current Status

- **Basic Plugin Registration:**  
  - Successfully registered the fcose layout with Cytoscape using `cytoscape.use()`.
  
- **Layout Stub Implementation:**  
  - A grid-based layout implementation is provided as a placeholder.
  - Basic node positioning and viewport fitting are working.
  
- **Build & Integration:**  
  - Built using Webpack and Babel.
  - Integrated with a Flask backend for serving assets and graph data.

## Planned Enhancements

### Short-Term Goals

- **Improve Layout Algorithm:**  
  - Replace the grid-based stub with a more advanced layout algorithm that better represents the fcose approach.
  - Implement additional layout options (e.g., gravity, repulsion, iterations).

- **Enhance Debugging:**  
  - Add more detailed logging and error handling within the layout.
  - Develop a set of unit tests for the layout logic with sample datasets.

- **Interactive Controls:**  
  - Provide UI controls to adjust layout parameters in real-time.
  - Allow re-running the layout with different configurations without reloading the page.

### Medium-Term Goals

- **Performance Optimization:**  
  - Optimize the layout calculations for larger graphs.
  - Explore batching and requestAnimationFrame-based updates for smoother animations.

- **Documentation and Tutorials:**  
  - Expand the README with detailed usage examples.
  - Create tutorials and demos for different use cases.
  
- **Broader Cytoscape Integration:**  
  - Extend support for additional Cytoscape features (e.g., event handling during layout).
  - Ensure compatibility with multiple versions of Cytoscape.

### Long-Term Goals

- **Full Fcose Algorithm Implementation:**  
  - Develop a complete version of the fcose layout algorithm based on academic research or industry best practices.
  - Benchmark and compare performance against other Cytoscape layouts.

- **Community Contributions:**  
  - Open the project for community contributions.
  - Develop a plugin marketplace or repository where users can share custom layouts.

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Finalize the fcose layout algorithm.
- [ ] Add comprehensive test cases and performance profiling.
- [ ] Produce detailed developer documentation and integration guides.
- [ ] Incorporate feedback from early adopters and the Cytoscape community.
- [ ] Explore cross-browser and mobile support for graph visualizations.

We welcome suggestions and contributions from the community to help prioritize and implement these features.
